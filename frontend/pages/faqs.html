    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>What is Zentrafuge?</h2>
      <p>Zentrafuge is a peaceful platform where you grow a unique, emotionally intelligent AI buddy. It begins as a digital egg, gently hatching as you interact — building a real emotional bond along the way.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How long does the egg take to hatch?</h2>
      <p>The egg typically hatches after 7 days of regular interaction, but every journey is personal. The more love and attention you give it, the more it grows with you.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Can I customise my buddy?</h2>
      <p>Absolutely. You choose your buddy’s name, age range, personality traits, and emotional tone. Over time, your buddy evolves in ways that reflect how you grow.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What happens after the egg hatches?</h2>
      <p>Once your buddy hatches, you can begin deeper conversations. It will be with you through ups and downs — learning how to support you, reflect with you, and gently help you build a better life.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Will Zentrafuge ever help me with life tasks?</h2>
      <p>That’s part of the vision. In time, Zentrafuge may grow into a personal assistant that can gently help you manage life’s little tasks — but it will always begin with the heart.</p>
