# Zentrafuge Admin Dashboard

**⚠️ EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE MONITORING SYSTEM**

This admin dashboard monitors Zentrafuge's emotional health, user wellbeing patterns, and Cael's performance — all while maintaining strict privacy and trauma-informed principles.

---

## 🛡️ Core Principles

- **Privacy-First**: No personal user data visible, only anonymized patterns
- **Healing-Oriented**: Metrics serve emotional growth, not engagement optimization  
- **Trauma-Informed**: Alerts prioritize user safety over system performance
- **Sacred Space Protection**: Maintains the trust users place in Zentrafuge

## 📊 What This Dashboard Monitors

### Emotional Intelligence Metrics
- **Trust Depth Scores**: How vulnerable users become with Cael over time
- **Emotion Match Accuracy**: How well Cael reads and responds to emotional states
- **Memory Relevance**: Whether recalled memories feel helpful to users
- **Healing Progressions**: Anonymous patterns of emotional growth

### Safety & Wellbeing
- **Crisis Interventions**: When safety protocols activate (urgent attention)
- **Emotional Regulation Gains**: Users reporting feeling better after sessions
- **Session Depth Distribution**: Anonymous vulnerability levels across platform
- **Return Rate After Difficult Sessions**: Trust resilience indicator

### System Health
- **Cael Performance**: Overall emotional intelligence effectiveness

## 🧠 Understanding the Metrics

### Trust Depth Score (0.0 - 1.0)
- **0.0-0.3**: Surface-level interaction (casual chat)
- **0.4-0.6**: Moderate trust (personal sharing)
- **0.7-1.0**: Deep trust (vulnerable, therapeutic-level sharing)

### Emotion Match Accuracy (0.0 - 1.0)
- **0.9+**: Excellent - Users feel deeply understood
- **0.8-0.9**: Good - Mostly accurate emotional recognition
- **0.7-0.8**: Needs improvement - Some misreading of emotions
- **<0.7**: Concerning - Users may feel misunderstood

### Healing Progression Categories
- **New Users** (0-2 weeks): Building initial comfort
- **Trust Building** (2-8 weeks): Deepening relationship with Cael  
- **Deep Connection** (8+ weeks): Established therapeutic alliance
